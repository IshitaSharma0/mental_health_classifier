# 🧠 Mental Health Text Classifier App

This project is an NLP-based Streamlit web app designed to detect signs of mental health distress in user-written text using a trained deep learning model.

## 🚀 Features
- Text preprocessing with lemmatization
- Bi-directional LSTM model
- Focal loss for handling class imbalance
- Custom tokenizer (tokenizer.pkl)
- Pretrained model (`mental_health_model.h5`)
- Streamlit frontend

## 📁 Files
- `app.py` – Streamlit app script
